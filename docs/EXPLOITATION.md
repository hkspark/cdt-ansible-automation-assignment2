Vulnerability Name: Insecure Cryptography / Transfer of Data

CVE: CVE-2025-2704 - OpenVPN version 2.6.1 through 2.6.13 in server mode using TLS-crypt-v2 allows remote attacker to trigger a denial of service by corupting and replyaing network packets in the early handshake phase
  Closest CVE to OpenVPN using inecure cryptography to allow a remote attacker to eavesdrop

Severity: Moderate
  Impact: Moderate
  Reason: Eavesdropping during the TLS handshake allows for an attacker to gain access to the CA certificate as well as the client's private key and the server's private key due to the fact that it uses RSA encryption.

Attack Vector: An attacker would be able to sniff network traffic and see the vulnerable TLS 1.0 - 1.2 being used along with RSA encryption. This would lead them to being able to produce a Man In The Middle attack and gain trust from the OpenVPN server or gain knowledge of certificates and private keys. With this knowledge, attackers could use the certificate to spoof as a CA or use the private keys in order to spoof as the client.

Tools used: Wireshark, Nmap for open ports

Exploitation:
  Sniff network traffic during the intitial TLS handshake
  Use a POODLE attack in order to decrypt the data found
  Once the POODLE attack has decrypted the data the attacker can use this for spoofing as the client or CA

After Exploit:
  If the attacker were to spoof as the client, they could gain access to the OpenVPN server along with the associated tunneled IP address. This could cause other servers to believe that the attacker was the client and grant them access to sensitive information. The attacker would be able to authenticate with other PKI services using the client's public and private keys.
  If the attacker were to spoof as the CA, they would be able to give out certificates to other services such as websites, VPN services, and possibly emails. If they were to grant multiple malicious services using this CA certificate, they would be able to trick people into thinkig it was a secure website and infect them with malware or gain sensitive informaiton.

Blue Team Detection:
  Configuration Files: Harden the configuration files to use a minimum of TLS 1.2 and update OpenVPN to the latest version available
  Sniff Network Traffic: See the vulnerable network service being used and adjust firewalls or network configurations

Blue Team Mitigation:
  Change the configuration files to ensure secure transit of information
  Improve the firewall security and block unecessary ports
  Review logs to ensure no unidentified IP address has been given a tunneled IP address
